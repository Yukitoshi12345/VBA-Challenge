<h1 align = "center"> VBA Challenge </h1>

In this VBA project, I developed a script that processes stock data across multiple quarters. The script loops through each stock ticker symbol for every worksheet, which represents different quarters. For each stock, it calculates and outputs essential financial metrics, including the quarterly change in price, percentage change, and total volume traded. Additionally, the script identifies and returns the stock with the greatest percentage increase, the greatest percentage decrease, and the greatest total volume for each quarter. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into stock performance over time. By automating these calculations, the script enhances efficiency and accuracy, making it an indispensable tool for financial analysis and decision-making.

## Criteria

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:

```
- The ticker symbol
- Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
- The total stock volume of the stock.
- Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
- Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every quarter) at once.
